# Getting Started

Hi, I'm Ghazi 👋

I'm a self-taught cybersecurity learner based in Pakistan. I hold the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** and **CompTIA Security+**, and I'm currently building my skills through hands-on labs, scripting, and projects.

This repository is part of my learning journey — a place to document my progress and build public-facing work to show potential employers and collaborators.

## What I'm Working On:
- 📘 Linux command-line security tools
- 🛡️ Vulnerability scanning labs (Nmap, OpenVAS)
- 🧠 Cybersecurity study notes (CIA Triad, risk management, hashing)
- 🐍 Python scripts for port scanning and hash checking
- 🖥️ Wireshark traffic analysis

Stay tuned as I continue uploading my projects here!
